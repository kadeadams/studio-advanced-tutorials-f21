# Studio Advanced Tutorials - Fall 2021
## Welcome to the Advanced Track!
In this weekly workshop series, you will learn advanced programming concepts and Unity packages which can be used to make more interesting games and speed up development. If you have prior coding experience, and would like to learn more, this is the series for you! Prior Unity experience is optional, as long as you are also attending the [Beginner Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-beginner-tutorials-f21). Live workshops will take place at **[TBD]**, but if you can't attend in person you can also watch edited recordings on our YouTube channel. Unlike the Beginner Track, most of these workshops are independent and do not build upon the previous workshop. But we still encourage you to attend as many as you can to maximize your learning!

We also offer the [Beginner Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-beginner-tutorials-f21) and Art Track. The Beginner Track covers the fundamentals of game development and using the Unity game engine, and is a good starting point for people without prior programming experience. The Art Track focuses on non-coding aspects of game development, such as animation, writing, and sound design, and is open to newcomers learning Unity through the Beginner Track as well as creatives with prior Unity experience.
